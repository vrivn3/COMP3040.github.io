Remember to use each step to explain both how to follow the tools and model Etter recommends and how to host a resume in GitHub Pages or Codeberg Pages. It's up to you whether you
1) begin with Etter's general process and then demonstrate the process with a practical step involving your resume, or
2) 2) begin with the practical steps for hosting a resume and relate each practical step to a concept in Etter's book.
Add an animated gif: Include a demo using an animated gif in your README. The gif should feature your own resume (showing your own name).

### Uploading Your Resume

1. **Accessing Your Repository**:

   - Navigate to your GitHub profile page and click on the repository you created for your resume.

2. **Initiating Upload**:

   - locate and click on the **"+"** icon near the green "Code" button. From the dropdown menu, choose **"Upload files"**.

3. **Adding Your Resume**:

   - Click on the **"Choose files"** button to select your resume file from your computer. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file directly into the designated area.
   - Ensure your resume file is appropriately named **index.md** (Make sure that your resume file is named index.md. This particular filename is essential because GitHub recognizes it as a special file and will display it on your static website accordingly).
   - After selecting the file(s) you wish to upload, click on the **"Commit changes"** button at the bottom of the page.

4. **Verifying Upload**:

   - GitHub will display a progress bar indicating the status of the upload. Once completed, the file(s) will be listed in your repository.

5. **Optional: Adding a Commit Message**:

   - Before committing changes, you may choose to provide a brief description of the upload in the **"Add an optional extended description"** field.

6. **Reviewing Your Repository**:
   - After the upload process is finished, navigate back to your repository's main page. You should now see your resume file listed among the files in your repository.

By following these steps, your resume is successfully uploaded to your GitHub repository.

### Formatting a Document Using Jekyll (a Static Site Generator)

To format the resume and give it a nice appearance, we will be using **Jekyll**, a static site generator included in GitHub. This works by adding a **\_config.yml** file that will contain our desired theme for formatting the resume.

1. **Creating the Configuration File**:

   - Click on the **"+"** located near the green "Code" button.
   - Select **"Create new file"** from the dropdown menu.
   - Name the file **\_config.yml**.

2. **Configuring the Theme**:

   - In the newly created \_config.yml file, type in: `theme: jekyll-theme-THEME-NAME`, replacing "THEME-NAME" with the name of the Jekyll theme you'd like to use.
   - Supported Jekyll themes can be found [here](https://pages.github.com/themes/).
   - Click on **"Commit changes"** to save the \_config.yml file.
   - GitHub will take some time to apply the selected theme to your resume.

3. **Previewing Your Resume**:
   - In a new window, navigate to your static website page by typing **Github_Username.github.io**. For example, if your GitHub username is "joe," your static website page link will be joe.github.io.
   - This page will display your resume formatted with your chosen Jekyll theme.

By following these steps, your resume will have a professional and visually appealing appearance and will be hosted on you own static website.
